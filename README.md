# matriochkryption
Nested encryption with a (substantial) touch of steganography

A CTF challenge made for Toulouse Hacking Convention 2018 as part of the
"projet long" of the TLS-SEC training.

## Organization of the repo
    * directory `doc` is intended to gather documentation about the challenge,
    for instance a description, a write-up and a launchin procedure
    * directory `src` contains the core of the challenge, that is to say its
    code and more generally any file required to make it work properly
    * directory `meta` contains files related to the challenge conception-wise,
    such as a progression recap.
