## Description

### Part 1
Wow! I heard about that conf from 31C3 on file formats tweaks and the result is pretty impressive.

Will you find what is hidden inside that matryioshka?


### Part 2
You need to solve the first part of the challenge first.


## File provided to the challenger
* `./export/<file_shasum>.png`


## Build the challenge
* Create a Python virtual environment and install the requirements listed in `requirements.txt`
* Source the virtual environment
* `make phase1`
* In Audacity:
    * Open `./build/spectro.wav`
    * File > Import > Audio > browse to `./build/morse.mp3`
    * Select All, Tracks > Mix > Mix and Render
    * File > Export > Export as MP3 â†’ `./build/audio.mp3`
* `make phase2`

## Update flags or config files
Update `config/flag1` (intermediate flag), `config/flag2` (final flag) or another file in `config/` and rebuild the chall (see above for rebuilding).

List of files in `config`:
* `flag1`: intermediate flag (flag of 1st part)
* `flag2`: final flag (flag of 2nd part)
* `pdf_template`: template text used for generating the music score (pdf document)
* `vc_passphrase`: decryption passphrase for the VeraCrypt volume

Some more files can be provided and are automatically created if not already present in `config/`:
* `png_key`, `png_iv`: key/iv pair to use to decrypt png file into pdf file
* `pdf_key`, `pdf_iv`: key/iv pair to use to decrypt pdf file into mp3 file
* `mp3_key`, `mp3_iv`: key/iv pair to use to decrypt mp3 file into mp4/VC hybrid file


## Organization of the repo

* directory `assets` contains the resources which are necessary to build the
    challenge
* directory `config` contains the config files necessary to build the challenge
    as well as both flag files
* directory `doc` is intended to gather documentation about the challenge,
    for instance a description, a write-up and a launchin procedure
* directory `src` contains the core of the challenge, that is to say its
    code and more generally any file required to make it work properly
* directory `meta` contains files related to the challenge conception-wise,
    such as a progression recap.
