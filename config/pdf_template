Oh, it seems you got that step right, well done!
You might want to use what follows to proceed to the next phase: 
key: <put_key_here>
iv: <put_iv_here>
Actually, before you go, here is a flag: <put_intermediate_flag_here>.
Use it to validate the first part of the challenge, and good luck for the
second one!

Wait, I'm still not done yet. Don't throw away that pdf document too fast,
it may somehow contain data useful for a further step :)
